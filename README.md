## Scopes

1. Hoisting: Variable or Function or Class declartions are hoisted(moved) to the top of the scope.
2. No block scope in ES5, use a design pattern IIFE(immediatly invoked function expression) to create one.
3. ES6 introduces the block scope => let and const
4. let and const create a block scope and are not hoisted.
5. Global scope: Visible everywhere. There is a global object and everthing declared globally are members of the global object. In the browser the global object is the window object
